# Online-News-Portal-using-PHP-and-MySQL
In this repository, I demonstrated a "Online News Portal" web application using PHP and MySQL. This is a web database application system that is to be used by the public to read and search news. The system keeps the record of all the admin, authenticated viewer. This system also has the ability to keep track of the news as well as comment record. This system also allows authenticated viewers to comment on specific news. This project intends to computerize online news portal system in order to provide the instant and important news and also to provide searching facility due to the grown size of records of news.
