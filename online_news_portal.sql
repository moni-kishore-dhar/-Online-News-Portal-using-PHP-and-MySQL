Nurul Haque along with his seven supporters was arrested from Matshaya Bhaban area around 8:30pm on Monday when they brought out a procession protesting the filing of the rape case. They were released several hours after the detention. Earlier in the day, Bangladesh Chhatra O Jubo Odhikar Parishad (Bangladesh Student and Youth Rights Council) demanded the withdrawal of â€˜false caseâ€™ filed against Nurul and five others. Its activists staged demonstrations in front of the National Press Club protesting the filing of the case and police action against Nurul and others. They placed a three-point demand during the demonstrations. The demands are: withdrawal of the case filed against the six, state must bear the treatment cost of the victims injured during the police action on Monday, and no obstruction to their peaceful movement. Nurul was elected VP in last yearâ€™s DUCSU polls, the first in 28 years. All panels, except that of Bangladesh Chhatra League, boycotted the election that was marred by allegations of irregularities.The ruling party student front dominated the polls but lost the posts of VP and social service affairs secretary.

Even the lightest and brightest furniture can look uncared for despite the best cleaning. In this case use colour therapy to take those monsoon blues away. Use pops of brighter colours like orange, yellow, red or electric blue to one focus wall or corner of your home. In case painting the house is challenging, use pops of colour for lampshades, floor lamps and throw rugs, upholster your sofa to bring the brightness. Or even use a couple of brightly coloured cushions to liven up your space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Use the outdoors well</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nLockdown has for sure made us appreciate the small nooks and corners of any outdoor spaces you may have. If you have a tiny balcony but a big dream, then monsoon is the best time to realise it. Use a wooden trellis to grow money plants, hibiscus or other hanging vines. Invest in some ergonomically designed furniture or use the simple jute and cane stools. Add a bunch of planters in bright colours and shapes to this space and watch your balcony or terrace bloom.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Go bare</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nMonsoons while lovely are a time for dirty tracks and mud shoes. Wrap up those durries, rugs, and carpets for the winter time and allow your floors go bare. Place aside heavy furniture as well, so that your interiors feel spacious and neat. And oh yes!

Agree that solidarity must not be optional,â€ said Prime Minister Robert Abela.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe 450-page proposals spanning five different pan-EU laws put emphasis on sending back those who fail to win asylum.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIntended to be in place from 2023, the plan also aims to open more legal routes for migrants, and work better with countries hosting people before they reach Europe.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt would also put EU countries with external borders under closer monitoring to stop illegal pushing back of people after reports of such action by Hungary, Croatia, Greece and Malta.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPeople saved at sea would be relocated in the bloc - rather than sent back - with charities not criminalised for rescues.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt times of regular immigration, EU states would be obliged to help under the new idea of â€œmandatory solidarityâ€ by relocating or sponsoring returns, or offering material assistance on the ground in arrival countries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf, however, a country were under major pressure, it could seek to activate a crisis mechanism under which EU peers would be obliged to take people in or send them back.\r\n<br><br>\r\nReturns commitments that fail to materialise in eight months - which national migration experts and some EU officials admit is tight - would transform into a relocation obligation, anathema to the easterners.\r\n<br><br>\r\nâ€œBottom line for us is that we might, and very probably will, end up with mandatory relocation,â€ said a senior diplomat from one of the eastern EU countries. â€œThat is a no go for us.â€\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat means the proposal faces an uphill battle despite having German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s backing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMerkel suffered electoral setbacks after opening Germany to Syrian refugees back in 2015. But in a sign of changing mood, German mayors now offered to take in Moria refugees and protesters even chanted: â€œWe have space!â€.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA Gallup poll, however, showed the world was becoming less tolerant of migrants, with EU states Hungary and Croatia near the top of the index of the least-accepting countries.', 'International', '03:43 AM', '03:43:18', '25/09/2020', 'Staff Reporter', '8'),
